# Learning-Databases

Repository to track and store my progress in learning about databases and SQL.

* See [Obsidian notebooks](https://github.com/haganenoneko/Learning-Databases/tree/master/Obsidian%20notebooks) for notes written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 
* See [Obsidian notebooks/Database System Concepts - Silberschatz](Obsidian%20notebooks/Database%20System%20Concepts%20-%20Silberschatz/) for notes from [Database System Concepts (Silberschatz et al.)](https://www.db-book.com).
* [Notes on SQL zoo problems](Obsidian%20notebooks/SQL%20zoo.md). I completed the exercises, but only included solutions that I found were interesting/difficult.
  * [SQL zoo solutions](Obsidian%20notebooks/SQLZoo_Solutions.sql)
* [Notes on Hackerrank SQL problems](Obsidian%20notebooks/Hackerrank%20SQL.md). As above, I only included exercises that were interesting/difficult. 

My goal is to learn SQL, some sort of ORM like Django, Spark, and basic database concepts.
